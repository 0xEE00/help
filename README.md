# Welcome to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (BC) is successor to Microsoft Dynamics NAV (NAV). Base code (this is the layer of which is shipped from Microsoft) is the same for both products. The difference is how customization is handled. With NAV partner makes changes directly to the Base code and ships in database to his clients. Each new update for Microsoft is a painful upgrade process. BC handles added code in different way with a focus to be fully upgrade-able each time. It comes with lot's of limitations. It's a challenge both for Microsoft and partners to overcome those limitations and will eventually put a side painful upgrade processes.

On top of Base Code partners has delivered extension called Adriatic Localization. It covers application translation and legal requirements for Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia. Help for additional features will be described separately.
